# Tutorial #1: Create an abridged bag from assets on a local filesystem

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will show how one can create an _abridged_ bag that uses `minid` identifers instead of regular
URLs to reference payload files. An abridged (or "holey") bag is a bag where one or more of the payload files
are not distributed with the bag but rather are remotely hosted and referenced by URL in the bag's
[`fetch.txt`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-16#section-2.2.3).
Our goal is to create a bag using only remote `minid` references to payload files hosted in cloud storage,
upload the bag to cloud storage as well, and finally mint a `minid` identifier for the bag itself.

This task consists of three stages:

1. [Prepare](#stage_1) the bag's payload files.
2. [Create](#stage_2) the bag, upload it to cloud storage, and publish the bag identifier.
3. [Test](#stage_3) the bag by downloading it, resolving (downloading) the bag's payload, and validating the completed bag.

<a name="stage_1"></a>
## Stage 1: Prepare the bag payload
In this stage, we will generate checksums for each of the bag's payload files, upload each file to cloud storage,
and batch publish identifiers for all of the remote payload files.

To keep things simple, the payload consists of only two files: a README.txt in the root of the payload directory,
and a JPEG image file in an `images` subdirectory.
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] ls -lgR fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input/
fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input/:

drwxrwxr-x. 2 mdarcy  31 Jun  5 23:38 images

```

We are now going to use a utility routine, `create-rfm-from-filesystem`, from the [`bdbag-utils`](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag/blob/master/doc/utils.md)
module to generate a [`remote-file-manifest`](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag/blob/master/doc/config.md#remote-file-manifest).
The `remote-file-manifest` is what `bdbag` uses to create bags that reference payload files remotely. The data from the `remote-file-manifest`
is what is used to generate both the bag's payload `manifests` and `fetch.txt` during bag creation. Conveniently, the `remote-file-manifest` format
is also compatible with the `minid` file manifest format and we will be using the output generated by this command to feed the `minid` CLI command `--batch-register` in a moment.

##### Command line:
```sh
bdbag-utils --debug create-rfm-from-filesystem --checksum md5 --base-url https://fair-research.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input --url-formatter append-path ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input ./ftbm-rfm-1.json
```

##### Explanation of arguments:
* The argument `create-rfm-from-filesystem` indicates the sub-command of `bdbag-utils` to run. In this case, it is the routine that creates a
`remote-file-manifest` by recursively scanning a local filesystem directory, calculating checksums for the files it finds, and then generating a target URL for
each file based on the additional URL creation arguments provided.
* The argument `--checksum md5` specifies the hash algorithm to use; in this case, `md5`.
* The argument `--base-url` specifies the base URL path to prepend to each filename when generating the `url` field. In this case, we have specifed
`https://fair-research.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input` as the base cloud path, since we know ahead of time that is the location we intend to
upload the payload files to.
* The argument `--url-formatter append-path` specifies that the existing relative path (including the filename) will be appended to the `--base-url` argument.
* The last two positional arguments, `./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input` and `./ftbm-rfm-1.json` are the input directory and output file path, respectively.

##### Output:
```
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] bdbag-utils --debug create-rfm-from-filesystem --checksum md5 --base-url https://fair-research.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input --url-formatter append-path ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input ./ftbm-rfm-1.json

2018-06-06 22:41:51,332 - INFO - 1 subdirectories found in input directory ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input ['images']
2018-06-06 22:41:51,332 - DEBUG - Processing input file ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input/README.txt

2018-06-06 22:41:51,334 - INFO - Successfully created remote file manifest: ./ftbm-rfm-1.json
```

The output file is a `remote-file-manifest` that can be passed directly to `bdbag` when creating a bag.
It can also be used as input to the `minid` command `batch-register`. Notice how the file contains the `md5` checksum in both
_hexadecimal_ and _base64_ encoded forms. This is because the `bagit` specification requires checksum manifests to use the
_hexadecimal_ form, while many HTTP/REST-based object stores (e.g., cloud providers) prefer the _base64_ encoded form.
Also note the relative path preservation in both the `filename` and `url` fields.
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] cat ./ftbm-rfm-1.json
[
  {
    "filename": "README.txt",
    "length": 398,
    "md5": "b597d3b1126a8db1f09fd70128f28f18",
    "md5_base64": "tZfTsRJqjbHwn9cBKPKPGA==",
    "url": "https://fair-research.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input/README.txt"
  },
  {
    "filename": "images/fair-research.jpg",
    "length": 324583,
    "md5": "51805244fa380526747d937731a75e9c",
    "md5_base64": "UYBSRPo4BSZ0fZN3MadenA==",
    "url": "https://fair-research.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input/images/fair-research.jpg"
  }
]
```

Now that we have our `remote-file-manifest` generated, which includes our checksums, it is time to upload our payload files to our distribution server, in this case Amazon S3.
Note that while the upload process is currently a "manual" process, it is technically possible to add automatic upload support to `bdbag-utils` in the future.

Practically speaking, this upload step can be done at any time. However, performing this step after generating the
`remote-file-manifest` has the benefit of allowing you to specify the `md5` when uploading the file to the distribution server.
When using AWS S3, the benefit of supplying this value during the upload phase is two-fold: 1) the `--Content-MD5` argument tells S3
to perform the equivalent hash calculation after it has received the file (thus ensuring the data integrity of the transfer), and 2)
the `--metadata md5chksum` argument adds the _base64_ encoded `md5` value as an object property which is then returned in the HTTP
header for GET and HEAD requests as `x-amz-meta-md5chksum`.
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] aws s3api put-object --acl public-read --bucket fair-research --key tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input/README.txt --body ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input/README.txt --content-type "text/plain" --metadata md5chksum=tZfTsRJqjbHwn9cBKPKPGA== --content-md5 tZfTsRJqjbHwn9cBKPKPGA==
{
    "ETag": "\"b597d3b1126a8db1f09fd70128f28f18\""
}
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] aws s3api put-object --acl public-read --bucket fair-research --key tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/input/images/fair-research.jpg --body ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid-input/images/fair-research.jpg --content-type "image/jpeg" --metadata md5chksum=UYBSRPo4BSZ0fZN3MadenA== --content-md5 UYBSRPo4BSZ0fZN3MadenA==
{
    "ETag": "\"51805244fa380526747d937731a75e9c\""
}
```

Next, we are going to create `minid` identifiers for each remote payload file listed in our `remote-file-manifest`. We perform this
step using the `minid` CLI command `batch-register`. This command will take our `remote-file-manifest` as input and generate `minid` identifiers
for each entry in the manifest. The output of this command is the manifest as it was input, but with one exception: the `url` field for each
manifest entry will now be replaced with the registered `minid` identifier for the referenced remote content.

##### Command line:
```sh
minid --batch-register ./ftbm-rfm-1.json > ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json
```
##### Output:
```
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] minid --batch-register ./ftbm-rfm-1.json > ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json
2018-06-06 22:45:27,623 - INFO - Checking if the entity b597d3b1126a8db1f09fd70128f28f18 already exists on the server: http://minid.bd2k.org/minid

```

Success! Now, let's query them just to be sure:
```

As you can see, the result output file `ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json` is a `bdbag`-compatible remote file manifest,
with all of the `url` fields replaced with the newly minted `minid` identifiers:
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] cat ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json
[
  {
    "filename": "README.txt",
    "length": 398,
    "md5": "b597d3b1126a8db1f09fd70128f28f18",
    "md5_base64": "tZfTsRJqjbHwn9cBKPKPGA==",

  },

    "url": "minid:b92695"
  }
]
```

<a name="stage_2"></a>
## Stage 2: Create the bag, upload it, and generate an identifier.
Now we're in business! At this point we have everything we need to create a bag from the new `remote-file-manifest`
containing freshly minted `minid` identifier references to our payload files. First, let's create an empty directory that we will
use as the basis for our bag. The directory is empty because our bag contains only remote file references and no local payload.
However, if we wanted to include some local payload at this point we could, just by copying files into the new bag directory.

##### Command line:
```sh
bdbag --checksum md5 --remote-file-manifest ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json --ro-manifest-generate update fair-tutorial-bag-minid
```

##### Explanation of arguments:
* The argument `--checksum md5` specifies the hash algorithm to use; in this case, `md5`. We want to specify the same checksum algorithm we used
when creating the `remote-file-manifest`, that way, any local files that might be added use the same hash algorithm and all payload files are therefore
consistent with regard to the hashing algorithm(s) being used.
    * TECHNICAL NOTE:
With regard to the `--checksum` argument, while it is possible to specify multiple hashing algorithms for bag payload manifests,
the `0.97` and older versions of the `bagit` specification (and `bdbag` and `bagit-python` by association) allowed for subsets of the overall set of
payload files in each manifest. In other words, you could have some files that used `md5` in the payload, and other that used `sha256` (or others) in the
same payload. As of the `bagit-1.0` specification, this is no longer allowed and `bdbag` versions `1.3.0` and greater comply with this restriction.
In other words, if multiple hash algorithms are specified during bag create or update, then a checksum of each specified hash algorithm must be specified for _every_ payload file in the bag.
* The argument `--remote-file-manifest ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json` specifies that the output file `ftbm-rfm-1-minid.json` from our `minid --batch-register`
command should be used as the input `remote-file-manifest`.
* The argument `--ro-manifest-generate update` is a new [function](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag/blob/master/doc/api.md#generate_ro_manifest)
in the `bdbag-1.3.1` release which causes `bdbag` to generate a basic `bagit-ro` [Research Object](https://github.com/ResearchObject/bagit-ro)
`manifest.json` as a tagfile in the `metadata` tagfile directory. The `update` keyword used with this argument instructs `bdbag` to update any existing
`metadata/manifest.json` file encountered in the bag, as opposed to the `overwrite` keyword which will replace it.
* The final positional argument is the bag path: `fair-tutorial-bag-minid`

##### Output:
```

```

Success! Now, let's have a look in that bag...
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] ls -lgR fair-tutorial-bag-minid
fair-tutorial-bag-minid:
total 20
-rw-rw-r--. 1 mdarcy 298 Jun  6 22:56 bag-info.txt

fair-tutorial-bag-minid/metadata:
total 4
-rw-rw-r--. 1 mdarcy 977 Jun  6 22:56 manifest.json
```

Nice, `fetch.txt` looks good!
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] cat fair-tutorial-bag-minid/fetch.txt
minid:b9611n    398     data/README.txt
minid:b92695    324583  data/images/fair-research.jpg
```

So does `manifest-md5.txt`.
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] cat fair-tutorial-bag-minid/manifest-md5.txt
b597d3b1126a8db1f09fd70128f28f18  data/README.txt
51805244fa380526747d937731a75e9c  data/images/fair-research.jpg
```

What about `metadata/manifest.json` - what got generated? As you can see, it is a bare-bones RO manifest. But, the good part is that the
`aggregates` section was generated automatically by introspecting the bag structure. Also, some of the basic provenance fields got populated
the same way, via `bag-info.txt`.
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] cat fair-tutorial-bag-minid/metadata/manifest.json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://w3id.org/bundle/context"
    ],
    "@id": "../",
    "aggregates": [
        {
            "bundledAs": {
                "filename": "README.txt",
                "folder": "../data/",
                "uri": "urn:uuid:ab664832-43f0-4cbe-85ee-552c98f9610d"
            },
            "mediatype": "text/plain",
            "uri": "minid:b9611n"
        },
        {
            "bundledAs": {
                "filename": "fair-research.jpg",
                "folder": "../data/images",
                "uri": "urn:uuid:ab664832-43f0-4cbe-85ee-552c98f9610d"
            },
            "mediatype": "image/jpeg",
            "uri": "minid:b92695"
        }
    ],
    "annotations": [],
    "authoredBy": {
        "name": "mdarcy",
        "orcid": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2280-917X"
    },
    "authoredOn": "2018-06-06T23:06:57+00:00",
    "createdBy": {
        "name": "BDBag version: 1.3.1 (Bagit version: 1.6.4)",

    },
    "createdOn": "2018-06-06T23:06:57+00:00"
}
```

OK, since everything is looking correct, let's go ahead and archive (serialize) the bag:
```
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] bdbag --archive zip fair-tutorial-bag-minid

2018-06-06 23:45:03,488 - INFO - The directory /home/mdarcy/fair-tutorial-bag-minid is already a bag.
2018-06-06 23:45:03,488 - INFO - Validating bag structure: /home/mdarcy/fair-tutorial-bag-minid

2018-06-06 23:45:03,491 - INFO - Created bag archive: /home/mdarcy/fair-tutorial-bag-minid.zip
```

Now let's upload it to S3. In this case, we are less concerned about providing a checksum to S3 because next we are going
to create a `minid` identifier for this bag and that process will create a SHA256 hash of the serialized bag and then associate the
hash value with the `minid` identifier. However, if you simply want to ensure the data integrity of the upload to S3, you could just run
`openssl md5 -binary ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid.zip | base64` and specify the output value as the `--Content-MD5` argument to the
`aws s3api put-object` command.
```sh
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] aws s3api put-object --acl public-read --bucket fair-research --key tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/output/fair-tutorial-bag-minid.zip --body ./fair-tutorial-bag-minid.zip
{
    "ETag": "\"230157df2f1c3886e18a04988c57150f\""
}
```

Finally, let's create a minid for the bag archive:
```
nih-commons:mdarcy[~] minid --register --title "Fair Research BDBag/Minid Tutorial #1 - Example Bag"  fair-tutorial-bag-minid.zip --locations https://fair-research.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/bag-minid/tutorial-1/output/fair-tutorial-bag-minid.zip

Let's verify that minid before we continue:
